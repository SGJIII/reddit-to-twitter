Notice I didn‚Äôt say I retired in 2023.\n\nI was a landscaper. The only work I have continued is taking care of four properties.

Title: Working side jobs after retirement ‚Äî not looking for ‚Äúlegal‚Äù advice
Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/1dj2rti/working_side_jobs_after_retirement_not_looking/
Content URL: 
Selftext: Hey y‚Äôall. I started drawing retirement in October ‚Äò23. Notice I didn‚Äôt say I retired in 2023.

I was a landscaper. The only work I have continued is taking care of four properties. These homeowners are my friends.

I‚Äôve kept my business open, and I have done the maintenance work for these friends under my business.

But to keep a business open requires expenses. General liability, workman‚Äôs comp, licensure, etc. I like taking care of these properties, but there‚Äôs no profit in it because of the business expenses.

Would it be legal/wise/advisable to completely shut down the business, keep taking care of these properties and just have the homeowners pay me instead of the business?  Would this be any different than any retiree doing a side huddle for spending money?

Thoughts?

I‚Äôm not asking for legal advice. I plan to discuss with my accountant. But I would appreciate your input here.

Thanks!

In retirement, finding a fulfilling side hustle can make all the difference. Many retirees take up positions like traffic flagging, which offers flexibility to work as needed.

For instance, one retiree works as an on-call traffic flagger in Oregon, choosing to work from October to May. This seasonal job allows for trips south to Arizona and summers at a cabin in Northern California.

Additionally, the retiree's side hustle provides an extra $30k annually, funding a yearly European vacation. This setup showcases how retirees can continue working if they remain healthy and wish to stay active.

Such opportunities highlight the benefits of having a flexible side job in retirement. This income supplement can cover travel and leisure expenses without dipping into savings.

On the investment front, we recommend looking into ETZ, a tax-advantaged crypto app. It allows retirees to buy, sell, and trade crypto instantly in retirement accounts without paying capital gains tax. Check out ETZ at https://etz.app.link/xslsTEtdxKb.

Brazil has faced gradual currency devaluation over the years, amplifying recently. üìâ This chart highlights the value loss in the last 5 years. https://imgur.com/YtirJ2g

Political instability has added to economic woes. Key figures being re-elected by slim margins and the subsequent 10% devaluation of the Brazilian Real within a year reflects this instability. üìâ

Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against local currency devaluation and rising costs like taxes. üí∏ There's a saying: "You only start to understand Bitcoin when you need it." This statement rings true now more than ever.

(the one thing you can always count on is change). It get\'s harder to keep up a social life when many we hung out with either moved away, or passed away. It\'s often difficult to accept changes and even more difficult leaving a home we lived in for so many years. And I got to tell you, moving is a pain. We moved from Oregon to Pennsylvania which entailed getting rid of, well over 50% of the stuff we own to accommodate a smaller living space. We had to prepare the house for sale then hire a realtor to make it happen, invite people into your house to see it and finally accept the best offer. That\'s when the deadline hits hard as you now know you have to be out of your house by a certain date. We sold one of our vehicles on Carvana, ordered a POD, loaded it up to be shipped to your new destination. We drove the other vehicle across the country which took us 6 days with stopping for meals and overnight hotels. But we made it and patiently waited of the POD to arrive.\n\nThe first couple of weeks entailed painting and working to make this small home, our home. It\'s funny how many things you find that either need replacement or upgraded in this new home.\n\nThe Community I live in has a lot to offer as far as building a new social life but due to the high tax area it is located in the rent is relatively high compared to Communities in other States. To keep rents low we don\'t have all of the amenities that others offer and we are all in charge of lawn maintenance on our lots. I have a landscaper who charges $18.00 per week and of course this is only so many weeks out of the year. We have a heated swimming pool which is outdoors and a bus trips each month to local historical sights, restaurants and other places of interest. We have clubhouse events for the holidays and a daily schedule of activities such as, crafting, chair yoga, canasta, mahjong, shuffleboard, poker, pinochle, computer club, bingo, along with more personal meetings like bible study, bereavement and book club.\n\nI enjoy playing sports and there are only so many sports offered that I am somewhat interested in. Bowling and Golf are both off sight and you have to pay for them, but pickleball and horseshoes are onsite and free. As I am sitting here on my porch I can see my softball glove and basketball sitting on the shelf and I wish that I could get out there and play both, but there is nothing available and many folks here are just too old or out of shape to play. We have a makeshift gym which I do utilize to stay in shape along with walking 10k each day, but the best and most enjoyable workouts for me are playing sports. I need to look into the local YMCA to see what they have to offer. Even at the ripe age of 63 I still have a great deal to offer team sports.\n\nIf you live in a Retirement Community I would be interested in hearing your story about the move to get there and the, "Good things and bad," your Retirement Community has to offer.', 'comments': ['Hi!

That's when the deadline hits hard as you now know you have to be out of your house by a certain date. We sold one of our vehicles on Carvana, ordered a POD, loaded it up to be shipped to your new destination. We drove the other vehicle across the country which took us 6 days with stopping for meals and overnight hotels. But we made it and patiently waited of the POD to arrive.

The first couple of weeks entailed painting and working to make this small home, our home. It's funny how many things you find that either need replacement or upgraded in this new home.

The Community I live in has a lot to offer as far as building a new social life but due to the high tax area it is located in the rent is relatively high compared to Communities in other States. To keep rents low we don't have all of the amenities that others offer and we are all in charge of lawn maintenance on our lots. I have a landscaper who charges $18.00 per week and of course this is only so many weeks out of the year. We have a heated swimming pool which is outdoors and a bus trips each month to local historical sights, restaurants and other places of interest. We have clubhouse events for the holidays and a daily schedule of activities such as, crafting, chair yoga, canasta, mahjong, shuffleboard, poker, pinochle, computer club, bingo, along with more personal meetings like bible study, bereavement and book club.

I enjoy playing sports and there are only so many sports offered that I am somewhat interested in. Bowling and Golf are both off sight and you have to pay for them, but pickleball and horseshoes are onsite and free. As I am sitting here on my porch I can see my softball glove and basketball sitting on the shelf and I wish that I could get out there and play both, but there is nothing available and many folks here are just too old or out of shape to play. We have a makeshift gym which I do utilize to stay in shape along with walking 10k each day, but the best and most enjoyable workouts for me are playing sports. I need to look into the local YMCA to see what they have to offer. Even at the ripe age of 63 I still have a great deal to offer team sports.

If you live in a Retirement Community I would be interested in hearing your story about the move to get there and the, "Good things and bad," your Retirement Community has to offer.
Comments: ['Hi! OP, original poster, put a lot into this one. Everyone make sure you have already hit the JOIN button first (on the sidebar , or landing page/ about section of the subreddit) so OP and other people can read your comment. While there view the rules/description (things like a strict No politics rule and we are geared towards those that retired at age 59 and 50s year olds that plan on traditional retirement age). Have a great day, MAM', 'I think you‚Äôre smart to relocate while you‚Äôre still young and energetic enough to make new friendships in your new home. But I want you to have people to play softball and basketball with! YMCA is a good start ‚Äî maybe also ask on a local Reddit?', 'Nice write-up. Thanks for this perspective. I think it sounds like a good lifestyle, especially for the kiddo-free.', 'I would look at [www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) to see if you can find (or start) a group of people to play other sports with....always a good idea to have friends not located in the retirement community but in the general surrounding community.']

Many retirees find themselves eating like they're on vacation, which can be unsustainable. üçî Social outings often lead to eating out more, causing a lack of dietary structure and discipline that used to come with a full-time job. #nutrition #retiredlife

Health concerns also become more prominent, with some fearing to get bloodwork done due to potential issues like high cholesterol or prediabetes. ü©∫ Anyone else facing this after retiring? What strategies are you using to improve? #healthyliving #retirementgoals

Selftext: It's the last week of the 2nd quarter and, as usual, BTC option market is an area of interest to look into to understand the current market state and potential movement.

Data of option market in deribit (https://metrics.deribit.com/options/BTC) at the time of this writing indicates that there's a huge amount, in terms of both number and notional value, of option contracts that will be settled by the end of this quarter (28Jun to be precised).

At present, the Max Pain Price is $57k.

Interestingly, a huge amount of Put contracts (option to buy BTC) will be basically worthless if BTC price is below $65K by 28Jun.

Is this the potential reason why the BTC price is being surpressed? It's whale game so you'll never know. At least it seems that the Bears are winning and there's no sights saying this trend will change any time soon.

It's the last week of the 2nd quarter and BTC option market is an area of interest for understanding current market state and potential movement. Huge option contracts will be settled by 28Jun.

Data from Deribit shows a massive amount of both number and notional value of option contracts expiring at the end of this quarter. The Max Pain Price stands at $57k.

A significant number of Put contracts (option to buy BTC) will be worthless if BTC price remains below $65K by 28Jun. Are whales suppressing BTC prices? Current trends suggest Bears are winning.

Approaching retirement, a common concern is whether long-held projects will finally get done or fade away. Many retirees find themselves looking for part-time jobs or volunteering opportunities. #RetirementPlanning #FutureGoals

Despite interesting careers, work often feels like it interferes with personal life and hobbies, leaving many side projects unfinished. Will retirement provide the necessary time to complete them? üïí‚ú® #WorkLifeBalance

Some, like hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts, worry that the same time constraints will persist post-retirement. Even dedicated projects might remain incomplete. #Hobbies #RetirementLife

Volunteering can be fulfilling, but balancing it with personal projects is crucial. For instance, someone might consider helping at a parrot store but feel their own projects take priority. ü¶ú‚ù§Ô∏è #VolunteerWork #Priorities

Many retirees discover that interests and priorities can change, sometimes unexpectedly. It's important to stay flexible and open to new experiences. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #Adaptability #NewBeginnings

This fiat game is rigged anyway.

It's a shitcoin with a button for printing more coin at the whim of a centralized entity. There's no proper oversight, it's heavily centralized, there's an infinite supply, no way for us to participate in any real governance. Even if I vote for a President, Prime minister, etc... my vote isn't really gonna have a say in who's in charge of the central banks and some of the monetary policies.

This might be fine for a government currency for government needs. But it's not good for me.

It might be more volatile and have more swings, but at least it's not constantly manipulated into a downward spiral.

I just no longer believe.

That's why I'm putting my fiat into BTC, ETH, and a few alt coins, while there's blood on the street, and they are being oversold in an emotional panic, while there's no bad news or anything fundamentally wrong the technology. In fact, we've had quiet a lot of good news about crypto this year.

Sending prompt to OpenAI: Please take this reddit post and use it to write a twitter thread. The first tweet should just include the exact post title 'Here's why I'm selling all my bags and no longer believe. This game is rigged.' in double quotes, the external link () if it exists, otherwise use the https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1dnimgj/heres_why_im_selling_all_my_bags_and_no_longer/ and relavant hashtags. If an external link () exists, use that in the first tweet instead of the post url (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1dnimgj/heres_why_im_selling_all_my_bags_and_no_longer/)Then if there is any text in the post I'm selling all my bags of fiat toilet paper. I'm done with them. It's a rigged system.

You should talk in first person plural when referring to ETZ usng we or us and not they or themIf there is a link in the post to an image or an article please include the link  in the postNever address me. Just send me the twitter threadNever include thread numbers like 1/8 2/8 etcNever mention the reddit thread directly in the tweetBe factual and never corny of over enthusiastic but feel free to use emojis and always include relvant hashtagsNever speak in the first personDon't make up any factsMake sure every tweet makes senseNever add any additionsl text that wouldn't go into the tweet and be postedHere are the links to the website: https://etzsoft.com/ and the app:https://etz.app.link/xslsTEtdxKb always use the entire link it will break if you don't include the .link/xslsTEtdxKb part

Selling all fiat because it's a rigged system! üè¶ It operates like a "shitcoin" with a button for printing more at the whim of centralized entities. No proper oversight, infinite supply, zero real governance. Why trust it? #Fiat #CurrencyManipulation

The potential for fiat to drastically devalue is always there. Just look at how the Yen has performed. One can never be too sure about these traditional currencies. üìâ#Fiat #Yen #Economy

Government currencies might work for state needs, but it‚Äôs not beneficial for individual financial freedom. With infinite supply and constant downward manipulation, the game is certainly rigged. #FiatCurrency #CentralBanks

Instead of fiat, putting faith in BTC, ETH, and a few alt coins appears promising, especially when bought during emotional market sell-offs. Notably, there has been good news surrounding crypto tech this year. üìà#Crypto #Bitcoin #Ethereum

OpenAI Response: "Julian Assange is FREE" https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1do4ttg/julian_assange_is_free/ #JulianAssange #Bitcoin #WikiLeaks

Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has reportedly been freed. This development has sparked discussions worldwide about transparency, freedom of speech, and the role of cryptocurrencies. 

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been instrumental in supporting WikiLeaks financially when traditional financial systems blocked their accounts. This has highlighted how decentralized currencies can empower movements advocating for free speech.

For those interested in investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, we recommend using ETZ, a tax-advantaged crypto app. With ETZ, you can buy, sell, and trade crypto instantly in retirement accounts without paying capital gains tax.

At 59, many feel enthusiastic about working, but the allure of retirement is strong. It's crucial to balance 401K, pensions, and healthcare to determine the best course of action.

One option to consider is retiring for 6 months to a year before returning to work. However, it's important to know if your 401K disbursement can be paused should you resume employment.

Those who take a new job and retire years later might miss out on significant healthcare benefits due to a short service time at the new company.

In these situations, it's important to weigh benefits and time commitments carefully to avoid missing out on crucial retirement advantages.

For those navigating retirement and employment options, #ETZ offers a tax-advantaged crypto app for managing investments without capital gains tax, making retirement investing easier and more profitable. More info: https://etzsoft.com/ and https://etz.app.link/xslsTEtdxKb #Crypto #TaxAdvantage
